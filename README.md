# CPSC 312 Barbershop Scheduler

This is a group project for CPSC 312, 2021, UBC. 

We will create a customer scheduler for barber shops in Haskell language. The users will be able to choose their barbers, their preferred time, or search for available slots.

# To run the scheduler
Enter   "ghci",
        ":load main"
        "run"

There are 2 barbers in the application, choose "Tom" or "Tony" then choose your preferred schedule.
